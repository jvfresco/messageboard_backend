## Message board app backend

This is the backend for a web application that posts messages in a board in real time thanks to websockets

This is the first project I've worked on using Nodejs and it is part of an Academind course

- Nodejs with Expressjs
- MongoDB with mongoose
- Websocket with Socket.io

Other packages

- Bodyparser
- Expresss-validator
- Bcryptjs
- Jsonwebtoken
- Helmet
- Compression
